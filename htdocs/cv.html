                        <h1>WORK EXPERIENCE</h1>
                       <h2>Event Host</h2> 
                        <p>Esprit Catering agency</p>
                        <p>September 2015 to Present</p>
                        <p>As my Chessington contract ends in winter I got a job at a catering agency called Esprit, to cover me until Chessington opens back up. At Esprit I worked as a waiter or a runner. When I am a waiter my role is to serve my set tables by taking their orders and assisting them with whatever they need. This role requires me to have great communication skills, as the people I would be serving was very upper class, so they naturally will need a higher level of service. When I was a runner my role was to simply carry trays of food to a set table, but I had to always look professional, also I had to keep eye contact with the floor manager as they would be the one guiding me on what route to take and where to put the food. 
                        Working at Esprit taught me how to be professional and how to provide a high level of service.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Park Presentation Host</h2>
                        <p>Chessington World of Adventures</p>
                        <p>April 2015 to March 2016</p>
                        <p>In this role my main job was to keep my set area clean and clear from litter. I did this by doing everything at a set time, for example if I had to do the bins in my area I would always do a bin run as soon as I started, so that I knew all of my bins are empty. Then I would do one before my break, just so that the other person on my area won't have to worry about the bins. Just before close I would then do a final bin run so that the area will be clear in the morning. 
                        Furthermore, during my time working in PP I learned how to use a radio with proper radio etiquette and how to work in a team.</p>

                        
                        <h2> Presentation Team Leader</h2>
                       <p>Chessington World of Adventures</p>  
                        <p>London</p>
                        <p>April 2016 to September 2016</p>
                        <p>In April I got promoted to team leader. This role needed me to set up and be the one to give orders, to help lead the team to our department goal. I did this by leading from the front and setting an example. 
                        This role taught me a lot about staffing as I was trusted to calculate the hours my team worked and send it to admin. I also had to call people and ask if they could come in as I notice my team was short on staff on some particular days. The whole experience of being a Team leader proved to me that I was able to lead and could one day become a manager.</p>
