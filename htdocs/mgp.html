   <h3>Why I choose dribble</h3>

   <article class="article">
<p>I tried to use Dribbble's website design as a model of good practise becuase I really like squares and boxes. I feel that this shape makes a website feel very simple and easy to navigate. 
</p>
<p>Moreover in some of the pages in Dribbble they put the infromation down the middle of a page in like a box shape with square shaped images within it. I believe this also makes the website more clear for the user as all of the information is clearly right infornt of them and they won't have to be looking around the page.
  This is why I tried to put the information on my pages in the middle to try and get the same effect that Dribbble's page gets on users. I also tried to use their box shaped images and links to make my website look more simple and inviting. 
  </p>
  <P>over time i will continue to add to my website to make it more like dribble. I'd start by making my images more square and the same size, so that I can have them in rows going down my page. which will also allow me to have more images on the page without taking up too much room. I'd also move my navigational bar to the top of the page and have it stay their on every page. theres other little things I would add to make my website more like dribbble's but they'll be implement overtime, but for example i could add a menu to my CV page that will act as a context page on the right side of the page, just like how the menu is on the second screenshot of dribble.</P>
