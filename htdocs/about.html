			I am Kieran Harris-Brown, the creator of this website. I love computers as I am fascinated by how they work and what they can do. From as far back as I can remember I’ve always loved learning about computers, which is why my favourite lesson was I.C.T. which is where I was inspired to be a web developer. Making high quality websites for clients is something I’d love to achieve. Which is why I am currently studying a computing course at the university of Northampton.
